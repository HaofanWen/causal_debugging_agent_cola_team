### 1. Automatically Detect the Programming Language of the Original Code
The programming language used in the provided code is Python, as indicated by the presence of typical Python constructs such as `class`, `def`, and `if __name__ == "__main__":`.

### 2. Provide a Complete Patched Version in the Same Language
Here's the patched version of the original code:
```python
from random import randint
import time

class UhOh(Exception):
    pass

class Hmm:
    def __init__(self):
        self.value = randint(-100, 100)

    def Yeah(self):
        if self.value == 0:
            return True
        else:
            raise UhOh()

def Okay():
    while True:
        yield Hmm()

def keep_trying(go, first_try=True):
    maybe = next(go)
    try:
        if maybe.Yeah():
            return maybe.value
    except UhOh:
        if first_try:
            print("Working...")
            print("Please wait patiently...")
        time.sleep(0.1)
        return keep_trying(go, first_try=False)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    go = Okay()
    result = keep_trying(go)
    if result is not None:  # Ensure the result is not None before printing
        print(f"{result}")
```

### 3. Brief Explanation of Changes
- **Added a Check for `None`**: Before printing the result, I added a check to ensure that the result is not `None`. This prevents potentially printing `None` if an exception occurs and no valid value is returned by `keep_trying`.
- **Minor Formatting Adjustment**: Ensured consistent spacing around the `f-string` in the `print` statement for better readability.

These changes ensure that the code handles potential exceptions more gracefully and maintains proper formatting when printing results.
