Automatically Detect the Programming Language of the Original Code\nThe programming language used in the provided code is Python, as indicated by the presence of typical Python constructs such as `class`, `def`, and `if __name__ == \"__main__\":`.\n\n### 2. Provide a Complete Patched Version in the Same Language\nHere's the patched version of the original code:\n```python\nfrom random import randint\nimport time\n\nclass UhOh(Exception):\n    pass\n\nclass Hmm:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.value = randint(-100, 100)\n\n    def Yeah(self):\n        if self.value == 0:\n            return True\n        else:\n            raise UhOh()\n\ndef Okay():\n    while True:\n        yield Hmm()\n\ndef keep_trying(go, first_try=True):\n    maybe = next(go)\n    try:\n        if maybe.Yeah():\n            return maybe.value\n    except UhOh:\n        if first_try:\n            print(\"Working...\")\n            print(\"Please wait patiently...\")\n        time.sleep(0.1)\n        return keep_trying(go, first_try=False)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    go = Okay()\n    result = keep_trying(go)\n    if result is not None:  # Ensure the result is not None before printing\n        print(f\"{result}\")\n```\n\n### 3. Brief Explanation of Changes\n- **Added a Check for `None`**: Before printing the result, I added a check to ensure that the result is not `None`. This prevents potentially printing `None` if an exception occurs and no valid value is returned by `keep_trying`.\n- **Minor Formatting Adjustment**: Ensured consistent spacing around the `f-string` in the `print` statement for better readability.\n\nThese changes ensure that the code handles potential exceptions more gracefully and maintains proper formatting when printing results."}
